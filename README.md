# iChart

A Python implementation of the Standard Celeration Chart (SCC). The SCC is a versatile graphing tool used in the field of Precision Teaching for analysis of response frequencies. I'm currently working on cleaning the code and fixing bugs. The goal is a free, simple and easy to use app for charting on desktop. Currently in alpha. Please contact me if you would like to be a tester.
