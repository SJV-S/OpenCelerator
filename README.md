# OpenCelerator

OpenCelerator (formerly named iChart) is an open-source Python implementation of the Standard Celeration Chart (SCC). The SCC is a versatile data visualization tool used in the field of Precision Teaching and other areas for analysis of frequencies. The project is currently in alpha. If something is not working, let me know! The goal is a free and easy to use app for charting on desktop. Will add an instruction manual in the near future.

#### Mac

Run one of these commands: Open the Terminal. Paste command. Press enter.

_Apple Silicon_
```
curl -L -o ~/Downloads/OpenCelerator-macOS.zip https://github.com/SJV-S/OpenCelerator/releases/download/0.12.0/OpenCelerator-e0.12.0-macOS-Sequoia-Apple-chip.zip && unzip -q -o -d ~/Downloads ~/Downloads/OpenCelerator-macOS.zip && open ~/Downloads/OpenCelerator.app && rm ~/Downloads/OpenCelerator-macOS.zip
```

_Intel_
```
curl -L -o ~/Downloads/OpenCelerator-macOS.zip https://github.com/SJV-S/OpenCelerator/releases/download/0.12.0/OpenCelerator-e0.12.0-macOS-Sequoia-Intel-processor.zip && unzip -q -o -d ~/Downloads ~/Downloads/OpenCelerator-macOS.zip && open ~/Downloads/OpenCelerator.app && rm ~/Downloads/OpenCelerator-macOS.zip
```

#### Windows

#### Linux

OpenCelerator is available as an AppImage and Flatpak, so FUSE or Flatpak need to be installed. If using the AppImage, do not place it in privileged directories. Tahoma is the default font on Windows and Mac, so consider installing Tahoma if you want the exact same chart appearance as the majority of users. Otherwise, DejaVu Sans is the fallback â€“ which is likely fine in most cases.

_AppImage_
```
sudo apt install libfuse2
```
```
sudo dnf install fuse-libs
```
_Flatpak_
```
sudo apt install flatpak
```
```
sudo dnf install flatpak
```
```
flatpak install --user OpenCelerator.flatpak
```

#### FAQ
- "I am getting a scary warning when installing." This is normal and inevitable when running unregistered third-party apps. The only way to avoid this is by purchasing a security certificate. That would cost a lot of time and money, and is unnecessary when the code is open-source. I am also transparent about my identity in the "About me" link above.
- "Is it possible to enter the data directly into the chart?" Yes. Go to "Home" and click on "Plot".
