# iChart
Interface for the Standard Celeration Chart (a graphing tool)

A Python implementation of the SCC (Standard Celeration Chart), which allows for analyzing learning of a wide range of behaviors using rate of response. I'm currently working on cleaning the code and making it available for free to everyone on desktop.
